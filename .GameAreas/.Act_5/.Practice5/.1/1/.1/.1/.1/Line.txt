???: Ah.
???: I see that you three have arrived, we have been expecting you.
Old Hen: This is one of the creatures that we have been talking about. A line.

The lines seem to be snake-like creatures. Their tails split off into three sections.

Line: You three may proceed to the next room. Perspe cares very little about who you are, so we only request that you make your presence known to her before entering.
