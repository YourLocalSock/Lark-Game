Line: Master Irifeir. I was curious when you would appear.
Irifeir: Why?
Line: Well, aside from already knowing that you were expected to us, Master Stridula has also showed himself here, and he seems to take you everywhere in recent times.
Line: If he didn't already have a servant in Myrne, I would be certain that you would have taken his place.
Irifeir: I don't know about that.
Irifeir: But... Why would master Stridula be here?
Line: He will be the one to return the Creature of Light to her home. He was the one that found her after all.
Irifeir: Right...
