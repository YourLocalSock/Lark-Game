echo "Perspe: A smaller creature, regardless of light or dark, will take care of a few small tasks to allow for Crash to become weak enough for us to return him to his normal form.."
echo "Perspe: I will allow for my servant to guide you to these for us, while we ensure that crash does not interfere."
echo "Perspe: When you are ready, Stridula will fly you to his web to begin the final preparations."
