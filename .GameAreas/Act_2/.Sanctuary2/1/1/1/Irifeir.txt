Irifeir: I just remembered.
Irifeir: Most spawners don't like to be disturbed during their work.
Irifeir: As such they tend to put puzzles around their homes.
Irifeir: I don't think that you will be able to solve this one with your current spells.
Irifeir: Go on ahead without me, there isn't much danger here.
