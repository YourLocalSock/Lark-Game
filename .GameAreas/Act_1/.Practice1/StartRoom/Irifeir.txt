Irifeir: This is it. My nest.
Witch: So, why did you lead me here?
Irifeir: Like I said, I have a plan.
Irifeir: But first I need to teach you something.
Irifier: Although there may seem to be multiple entrances, there is only one that is real.
Irifeir: I want you to use a spell to find the real one.
Irifeir: Use ls -l to determine the real entrance...please.
Irifeir: When you use it, you will see all paths before you, as well as a set of symbols before it.
Irifeir: The only ones I want you to focus on are the last three.
Irifeir: They will show you if you can cross it safely.
Irifeir: If you see an x among the last three, then it is safe to cross.
Witch: Do you usually talk this much?
Irifeir: ...No...sorry...
