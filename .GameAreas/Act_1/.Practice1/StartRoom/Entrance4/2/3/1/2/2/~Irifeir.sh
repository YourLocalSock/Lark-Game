echo "Irifeir: As you know, I serve Master Stridula."
echo "Irifeir: Not to the level Myrne, his dedicated servant, does, but he trusts me as well."
echo "Irifeir: With this, some of the other spawners are familiar with me."
echo "Irifeir: I think that I may be able to talk to one who could open a portal for us."

echo "Irifeir: You see, between each of the spawner's territories is an area where We of the Dark rest after being summoned into the light."
echo "Irifeir: We call it the Resplendency."
echo "Irifeir: You Creatures of Light cannot survive very long in the Resplendency."
echo "Irifeir: In other words, you need to move fast when we are in it."
echo "Irifeir: All of this was to teach you what you needed to use to get the the next Spawner's land."
echo "Irifeir: When you are all set here, meet me at the Magus Strand again."
