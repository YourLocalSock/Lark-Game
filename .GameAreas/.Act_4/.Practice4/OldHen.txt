Old Hen: Now I should warn you before I start to teach you.
Old Hen: The path we will be taking will lead us directly into the Replendency.
Old Hen: If you have anything that you left unfinished or forget, you may turn back now.

We wait for a few seconds, and when neither of us move, Old Hen continues again.

Old Hen: The first spell we will need you to learn is "grep".
Old Hen: This spell allows you to search for a word in any one of our archives.
Old Hen: As practcie, use "grep [word] [file]" to look for the word "tatali" in the file
Old Hen: Remember, the command is case sensitive
