echo "Narakaj: I would simply ask that you bring the Creature of Light to Perspe's den to discuss what the next steps will be."
echo "Narakaj: I still have prior commitments here, so I will provide you with my servant to teach you how to proceed."

echo "From the floor rises a bubbling black mass, that rises into a somewhat humanoid shape, before Narakaj brings one of his claws and down and crushes it."
echo "This mass then promptly reforms, but into a more unique shape."
echo "Its legs haev the same insectoid properties as Irifeir, but its head and body are more serpentine, like Narakaj."
echo "In fact, the being is essentially a smaller version of Narakaj."

echo "Narakaj: Old Hen, I would ask of you to teach these two the necessary spells to reach Perspe's den from here."
echo "Old Hen: Yes, Master. I will do so at once."
echo "Old Hen: You two, please follow me."
