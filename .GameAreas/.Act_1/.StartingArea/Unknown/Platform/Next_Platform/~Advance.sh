echo "When I become lucid again, I hear a voice from nearby."
echo
echo "???: She is aware, that much I know..."
echo
echo "I try to listen to what they are saying, but the voice stops me."
echo
echo "???: Open your eyes, I already know that you can hear me."
echo
echo "I comply, and am greeted with the sight of a beast roughly the size of a bear."
echo "It's legs are not one object, but instead several strands that swirl up to form the thigh of the creature."
echo "It's round head has a small snout on it, but what catches my attention is the white markings that covers its body."
echo "These markings are located at about where the eyes would normally be, the neck, and some on the underside of its wings."
echo "The entity before me moves its head slightly before speaking again."
echo
echo "???: Good."
echo
echo "When it speaks, it's 'mouth' doesn't move at all."
echo "It is at this moment that a second voice speaks up."
echo
echo "???-2: I'm so sorry, when you grabbed me I panicked and came back here, I didn't think you would come with me."
echo
echo "The voice belongs to a much smaller creature that is perched right beside me."
echo "It's the dragonfly creature."
echo "Although now I can see that it has a similar head shape to that of the larger one, but its body shape is very different, much more closer that that of, well, a dragonfly."
echo "It also bears the same white markings across its body."
echo
echo "???: Calm yourself Irifeir. I've told you not to worry about such things."
echo
echo "The smaller creature, Irifeir, looks back towards the larger one, and seems to sigh, although no air audibly leaves it."
echo "The larger creature turns back to me and speaks up once more."
echo
echo "???: You're quite a long way from home, Child of Light."
