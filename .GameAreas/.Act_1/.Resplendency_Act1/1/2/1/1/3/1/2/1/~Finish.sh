echo "Witch: Finally!"
echo
echo "As I run towards the end of the Resplendency, I suddenly feel my body grow several times heavier."
echo "Soon enough I fall over, and Irifeir takes flight in panic."
echo
echo "Irifeir: Huh... No, no, miss! You need to get up!"
echo
echo "As my vision starts to go dark... The light suddenly returns and my body feels normal again."
echo "I pick myself up, and Irifeir lands nearby."
echo
echo "Irifeir: Are you well miss?"
echo "Witch: Yeah. Why is that?"
echo "???: because you time comes later."
echo "???: stand."
echo
echo "The etity that stands before me is hard to describe."
echo "It resembles a man in its shape, but at the same time, it doesn't."
echo "It's slim body gives was to a slightly larger head."
echo "In place of legs, it has six that look more at home on an insect."
echo "And all around us float several white hexagons, most of which seem to gather around the entity's shoulders, making it look as though it has wings."
echo
echo "???: you live merely because you life, and all in this world, is written to end later."
echo "???: in time, all shall break under the weight of fate."
echo "Irifeir: Weight of--"
echo "Irifeir: Wait..."
echo "Irifeir: Are you Crash to Black? Eragalda's Servant?"
echo "Crash: correct."
echo
echo "Irifier looks dumbfounded for a few seconds before slowly begining to speak once more."
echo
echo "Irifeir: It is you who is preventing the opening of the portals?"
echo "Crash: correct."
#echo
#echo "With this statement, Irifeir tenses up."
#echo
#echo "Irifeir: W-well,  "
#echo
#echo "Even without knowing what their social cues look like, I can tell from the way that Irifeir speaks that he is frightened, despite his words."
#echo
echo "Crash: oppose me if you must. deny me if you can."
echo
echo "And with that, Crash vanishes into thin air."
echo "Irifeir is left frightened for a few moments before regaining his composure and launching forward."
echo
echo "Irifeir: We must continue onwards"
