---------------------------------------------------
Entering the "Armakur" the first thing that I notice is that there are large pillars of stone jutting through the webs.
The nearby dragonfly-esque creatures take notice of my presence.
Some take flight, others land and stare at us, but Irifeir seems unbothered by this.
That or he intends on ignoring them.

Irifeir: Good... you found me.
Irifeir: Over there, the one with the black stone on top, that is where my nest is.

He gestures to a large lone rock face. His nest stands towards the outer edge of what seems to be a large ring of rocks, and the webbing from the main web seems to go no further than it. The hole that must serve as the entrance is barely visible from here.

Irifeir: I don't think you'll be able to teleport to there from here.
Irifeir: The closest spot is in the Miritir. Come.

And with that he flies off once again.
Unless I intend on looking around, I should be following him.
