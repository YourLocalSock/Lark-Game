As I move to follow Irifeir, I take notice of my surroundings.
The web is at the top of a large chasm, with a river flowing at the bottom.
The small, floating patches of land seem to indicate that the web is above the area that I was in when I entered this world.
Irifeir makes a chirping sound to get my attention before speaking.

Irifeir: Don't lose track of me, okay?
Irifeir: The Magus Strand can be quite confusing.
Irifeir: We need to go over there - to the Armakur.
