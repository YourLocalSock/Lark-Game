I stand up on the web and find my footing before finally standing up once more.
Irifeir remains in the same spot as he has been the whole time, avoiding eye contact with me.
Before long, he speaks up.

Irifier: As Master Stridula has stated, it falls to me to ensure that you are returned home safely.
Irifeir: But... we need to take care of something first.
Irifeir: If you would follow me.

Irifeir proceeds to take off and fly off in one direction, before stopping and turning around as if waiting for me.
He remains like this for a few seconds before returning to the web.

Irifeir: Sorry... I suppose you can't use your spells to that extent in this state.

He turns around once more, and this time, makes sure to fly over easily accessable portions of the web, waiting for me to follow.
