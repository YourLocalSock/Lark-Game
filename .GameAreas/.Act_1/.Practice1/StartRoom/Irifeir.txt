The first room in Irifeir's nest is slightly more decorated, with more webs being spun along the walls.
Before me are five holes and, since there is no web for the entrance, I assume are hallways as Irifier's kind can fly.
Irifeir perches on my shoulder, and begins to speak.

Irifeir: In order to get to Marhargrah's home, we need to pass through an area known as the Resplendency.
Irifeir: We of the Dark go there normally to cleanse ourselves of the light after we enter your world.
Irifeir: However, as you have already experienced, you will not survive a stay of significant length within it.
Irifeir: So I thought to teach you an extension to one of your spells to be safe.
Irifeir: This spell is ls -l and I want you to use it to determine the path to the center of my nest.
Irifeir: It will show you all locations around you, but in the right corner of your vision, you will also see some symbols resembling r, w, x, and -.
Irifeir: I want you to focus on the last three in the line.
Irifeir: If it does not have r and x in it, it is unsafe for you to cross.
