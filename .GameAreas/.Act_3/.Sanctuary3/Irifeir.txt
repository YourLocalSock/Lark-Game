Donaktralda's home is somewhat similar to Marhargrah's, with the mountain.
Unlike her homwever, Donaktralda's home has a small castle on top of the mountain.

Witch: So what do you know about this Donaktralda?
Irifeir: Donaktralda is one of the three spawners the serve directly under the Mistress.
Irifeir: He, Narackaj, and Perspe all perform different jobs given out by her.
Irifeir: Donaktralda carries the spirits of any magic user from Iovadtis into the world of light, and spirits from the World of Light to the Mistress to be reborn.
Irifeir: However, Donaktralda is also a loner, and hates visitors very much.
Irifier: I will admit, I am kind of nervous about talking with him again.
Irifeir: Especially under these circumstances.
Irifeir: He is barely tolerant of one visitor, I don't know how he'll react to two.
