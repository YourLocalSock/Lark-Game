We approach a cliffside and look down at the area below us.

Irifeir: That's where we should go next after this. Narackaj's archives.

In the distance stands a massive tower, so tall that it seems to pierce the heavens.
But to get there we will first need to cross the resplendency, if past experience has taught me anything.

Witch: And what is the resplendency path to get to it?

Irifeir points me a little to the west, where there lies several waterfalls and cliffs.

Irifeir: I would normally expect us to straight to Narackaj's tower. But a spawner needs to cleanse you of the darkness after each trip into the resplendency. Donaktralda is the closest to both Marhargrah and Narackaj, so I suppose we need to talk to him to cleanse you.
