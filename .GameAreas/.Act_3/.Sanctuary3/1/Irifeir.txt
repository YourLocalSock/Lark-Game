The discussion of eyes
-------------------------------
Witch: I have been wondering for a while, what are those white markings all over yoru body?
Irifeir: These white spots?
Irifeir: These are our eyes.
Witch: Even the ones on your neck and wings?
Irifeir: Yes. That is how Master Stridula carried you to his web.
Irifeir: He carried you on his back, gripping your leg in his mouth.
Irifeir: He used the eyes on his neck to see where he was going while he carried you back.
