-------------------------------
Donaktralda leads us through the palace halls. Even still, none of it is decorated, much less lit up.

Donaktralda: Narackaj, the Archivist, would like for you to search for information before you enter his lair.
Donaktralda: There are three spells that will do this for you.
Donaktralda: However, I can only teach you two.
Donaktralda: The first is head, which will only allow you to look through the first ten lines of a file.
Donaktralda: I'm sure that you know what to do from here.

Use "head [file]" to look at the first 10 lines of a file
Use the head command whenever you see a "TopHeavyTool"
