Teleporting on to the ground patch, I observe my surroundings.
From where we just came out of the resplendency, I can see some of the anchor stones that form the outskirts of Stridulas Web.
To the right of the exit, there is a large palace rising from the ground.
Further still is a large tower that seems to exntend for forever.

A sound behind me snaps me from my thoughts.
Turning around, I find a creature that I assume must be one of the Koalklugs to be behind me.
It's form seems to resemble that of the Cassowary from my world. The main difference is that its head and legs appear to be made out of rocks from the mountain.
It ruffles its wings, revealing that they also posses the same qualities as its head and legs, and speaks in a very excited tone.

Koalklug: A creature of light!?

Startled, I take a few steps away from it.

Koalklug: I have not seen one of you here before!

Without Irifeir's guidance, I do not know how to react to this being before me.

Koalklug: Come! Come! I shall bring you to see Master Marhargrah.

Before I have a chance to speak, it turns and recites a spell that I do not know.

Koalklug: mv flalr path

I might have to remember that for later.

Koalklug: Come! Come! She must see you!
