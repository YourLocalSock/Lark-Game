echo "As we near the top of the mountain, I am surprised by the lack of any kind of structures in the area."
echo "Were as Strudula's Web had...well, webs everywhere laced between cliff faces and the ravine below us, the home of this spawner was almost entirely barren."
echo "I am startled from my thoughts as a long black tendril descends from the sky and begins to speak in a loud, booming voice that shook the ground around me."
echo "The only way I can tell this, is due to the large glowing white spot on its end."
echo
echo "???: A Creature of Light enters my domain..."
echo "???: How peculiar..."
echo
echo "It is at this moment that I realize that this is the spawner, Marhargrah."
echo "Due to his status as Stridula's assistant, I leave the talking to Irifeir."
echo
echo "Irifier: Master Marhargrah, I have come with a request."
echo "Marhargrah: Speak child, why have you brought one of the light to me..."
echo "Irifeir: It was my own mistake that this light being was brought to us, and circumstances prevent Master Stridula from returning her himself."
echo "Irifeir: I come to ask you to return her to her own world."
echo "Marhargrah: As much as I would prefer that it be done, I cannot seem to open portals into the light realm at current..."
echo "Irifeir: No... Crash denies you too?"
echo
echo "Marhargrah goes silent for a few moments before speaking once again."
echo
echo "Marhargrah: And it would seem I now have the why..."
echo "Marhargrah: I do believe that should have been what you led with Irifeir..."
echo "Marhargrah: Tell me, has Crash said anything of its reasoning..."
echo "Irifeir: The only hint that I have is that he claimed that 'It was not her', the creature of light's 'time to die yet.'"
echo "Marhargrah: I see..."
echo "Marhargrah: I shall have to inform the Mistress's own at once..."
echo "Marhargrah: In the mantime, it would do you well to see Donaktralda..."
echo "Marhargrah: He should be informed by the time you reach him..."
echo "Marhargrah: Makinet. Come out..."
echo
echo "Makinet emerges from behind the mountain side and regards Marhargrah with great trepidation."
echo
echo "Marhargrah: You have my permission to teach her of the spell of my spwaned..."
echo "Marharhgrah: However, once you reach the mountainside, you are to inmmediately break away from them, and join me at den of the Archivist..."
echo "Marhargrah: Is that clear, child...?"
echo "Makinet: ...Yes, master..."
echo
echo "And with that the tendril retracts back into the sky."
echo "Astounted I turn to Irifeir."
echo
echo "Irifeir: As you have likely already deduced, that is Marhargrah."
echo "Irifeir: She is the largest of spawners, as she is the clouds above us."
echo
echo "Makinet begins to move to the other side of the mountain, and signals for us to follow."
echo
echo "Makinet: Regardless, you heard what she said. I must now teach you another spell for the trip to Donaktraldas's lair."
