As the Koalklug brings me through the cave, I can see that it has brought me into a sort of congregation area.
The Koalklugs nearby seem to be wary of me. They must not have seen a creature of light either.
Nests are strewn about the cave, and there is an opening that overlooks the platforms were I was before.
That must have been how they knew I was here.
One of the Koalklugs approaches us, like the rest, eyeless, but with white markings strewn about their body.

Koalklug-2: What of the Night Crawler?
Koalklug-1: Didn't the others tell you? It flew off.

It stops and seems to get frustrated with my escort.

Koalklug-2: Very well...
Koalklug-2: And what do you intend on doing with this one.
Koalklug-1: Why take it to Master Marhargrah, of course.

The second Koalklug eyes the first suspiciously, but lets us go anyways.
