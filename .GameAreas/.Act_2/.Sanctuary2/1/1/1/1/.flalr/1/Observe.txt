As we exit the cave I hear signature buzz of flapping wings.
Irifeir.
The individual in question flies into me with such speed that I am almost knocked over, despite his small size.

Irifeir: WHERE DID YOU GO!?

As Irifeir berates me for leaving, he suddenly takes notice of the other Creature of Dark present.

Koalklug: Uh, hi?

Irifeir leaps off me and focuses his attention onto the Koalklug.

Irifeir: Makinet. Why did you take her. I told her to wait for me.
Makinet: Hey! Don't blame me! I was going to take her to Lady Marhargrah!
Irifeir: No you were not! You were going to take her to your nest and waste her time by asking her all sorts of questions.

The koalklug, Makinet, looks offended, at least as much as it can with its face, at such as notion.

Makinet: Waste her time? What a ridiculous notion. What exactly is she going to be doing here that has more importance than sating my curiosity?

Before Irifeir has a chance to respond, I remind him of my presence by clearing my throat.

Witch: As much as I would like to listen to you two argue, can we just get to this Marhargrah character, please?

Irifeir looks back to Makinet, before shaking his head and flying away from him.

Irifeir: Of course. Master Marhragrah's grounds are just up here.

I follow him up the slope, and Makinet does the same soon after.
