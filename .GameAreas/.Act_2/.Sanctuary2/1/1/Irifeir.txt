As we finally exit the cave, we find ourselves on a mountain. Gazing out, I see very little of interest. Irifeir, however, seems unbothered by this, instead he keeps moving his head up and down the sight before him.

Irifeir: The path up looks too dangerous for you.
Irifeir: We may have to go around...

Witch: So, uh... Who is this Marhargrah? What does she look like.
Irifeir: She is the spawner of the Koalklugs. I supposed the best way to describe them are... tall birds.
Irifeir: As for what she looks like, well...

He looks up towards the sky. Confused after several seconds of no response, I prompt him once more.

Witch: Well...?
Irifeir: You'll see.
