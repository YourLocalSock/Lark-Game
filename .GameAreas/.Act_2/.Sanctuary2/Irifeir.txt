Irifeir: If Crash really is the one that closed the portals, I'm not sure that Marhargrah could create a new one. Not like this at least...
Irifeir: You should stay sharp. This may not be out last stop...
Witch: Didn't Stridula say that he could send me back, why didn't you just talk to him about it.
Irifeir: Master tends to overwork himself, so the Mistress sometimes revokes his abilities and gives them to Margargrah so he has no choice but to relax.
Irifeir: I suppose that Master just didn't think that this time was any different from before.
Witch: Why give them to Marhargrah?
Irifeir: The two of them tend to work together on a lot of things. I suppose the Mistress thinks that Marhargrah was qualified enough from watching him that she could do it? I have no idea why otherwise.

///The witch remembering the discussion in the Resplendency
It seems strange to me that Irifeir, an individual seemingly so close to Stridula would be kept in the dark about such a thing. And then I remember what had just happened and another question enters my mind.

Witch: Back in the resplendency, when we encountered Crash.
Witch: You said that Crash was Eragalda's servant... what does that mean here?

Irifeir pauses.

Irifeir: How to explain it to you...

Before long, he looks back to me.

Irifeir: Each spawner has a servant of some kind.
Irifeir: For instance, Master Stridula has Myrne, you might not have seen him.
Irifeir: Each Spawner's servant has a fragment of the spawner's power, but lose their individuality in the process, adopting everything about the spawner except appearance.
Irifeir: Crash, servant of Eragalda, the Author of Fate, however, still retains his individuality for whatever reason.
Irifeir: And because the spawners close to the Mistress are quite silent on Crash's nature other than what I've already said, I can't say much more than that.
